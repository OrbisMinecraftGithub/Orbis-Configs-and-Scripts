#A mission is a quest that can be completed by a mission bearer. A mission bearer is an entity such as a town
#or a nation. Each mission has a set duration (or infinite). Once the mission expires it is failed. A mission
#is made up of many goals. There are many types of goals. The goal is then worked on by players and once completed
#rewards are handed to all those who contributed based on their contribution. When the mission is completed
#more rewards can be handed to the mission bearer as a whole.
